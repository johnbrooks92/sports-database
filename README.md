# Interactive Sports Database

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to engage in an interactive sports database. 

Features planned for implementation include, but are not limited to:

- API Integration for data regarding Football, Basketball, Baseball and Soccer.
- Render the non-contextualized statistics of each player upon search (PPG, Total TD, Home Runs, etc.)
- Render contextualized statistics that give more depth to the individual player's responsibilities/impact.
- Feature an athlete of the day, play of the day, fact of the day, and article of the day about brief history of one franchise/club
- Render highlights tagged to specific players or teams when search results appear.
- Customize user feed based on favorite teams as well as showing things that are cookies driven.
- Player comparison screen that weighs the careers of two players and determines more successful player based on specified metrics.
